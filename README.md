> ***trilogy*** is SQLite - but 100% pure JavaScript. Its core is built on two modules: [SQL.js][sqljs] for accessing and writing to database files and [knex][knex] for building its queries.

*note: trilogy is currently in active development and while it's currently in a high-functioning state, there may be bugs, untested features, and a lack of documentation.*

## Why?

You can stop building and rebuilding `sqlite3` for every platform - we already have a JS-only implementation in `SQL.js`. Forget about gyp or pre-gyp compilation issues.

You can stop writing raw, long and unwieldy query strings when `knex` can do the job easier and in a more JS-friendly syntax.

Best of all, think of the simplicity of something like the `nedb` embedded database. That's what you get when you use ***trilogy***.

## Installation

`npm i trilogy`
