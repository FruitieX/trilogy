<!--

Please read the [Contributor Guide](https://github.com/citycide/trilogy/blob/master/.github/contributing.md).

- include a description of the changes
- try to include motivating cases
- also try to provide before & after comparisons / expectations
- if this closes an issue, add `Closes #{issue number}` as the opening line
  - this also works for pull requests if you're replacing a previous one

Thanks for contributing!
